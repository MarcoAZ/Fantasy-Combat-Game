#Fantasy Combat Game
Two players select from five different types of creatures to battle each other. The team with the most points wins. Each creature gets a point for themselves and their team. The top three creatures are also listed at the end of the tournament.
This game is not balanced. It was an assignment that provided the character stats and was used to show my knowledge of polymorphism, abstract classes, and STL containers.
